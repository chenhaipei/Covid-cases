# Covid-cases
"As a UK citizen, I would like to know how cases of COVID-19 have been changing over time in my region."

Then I created Covid-cases: a React web page displaying the latest Covid-19 statistics for the UK, fetching data from the GOV.UK Covid-19 API  **https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide**

The user can search for a region and see more detailed breakdowns including intuitive Chart.js bar graphs
